            Hi there — I’m Boris Ding, a <span>Web Developer</span> from Malaysia who came to Singapore in year 2007.
            I currently work on advertising platform for <a href="http://global.rakuten.com/corp/worldwide/asia_oceania.html">Rakuten</a> and deal with the front-end stuff most of the time.
            </p>
            <p>
            Prior to Rakuten, I had been working on various web-based business applications which include ERP, CRM and project management systems for both server and client-side.
            </p>
            <p>
            I enjoy coding and focus on JavaScript and PHP programming languages. At the same time, I'm also dabbling in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework.
            When not doing with web stuff, I mostly spend my time on reading and photography.
            </p>
            <p>
