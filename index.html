            <ul>
                <li>I was born and raised in Malaysia and then came to Singapore in 2007.</li>
                <li>I officially graduated and earned my computer science degree from University of Technology Malaysia <a href="http://www.utm.my/">(UTM)</a> in 2006.</li>
                <li>I'm currently working as Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten">Rakuten</a>, based in Singapore.</li>
                <li>I write code and use JavaScript, PHP, CSS3 and HTML5 for crafting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web app</a> most of the time. I also dabble in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> lately - with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework.</li>
