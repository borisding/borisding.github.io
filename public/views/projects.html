Here is a brief of my personal projets worked in my spare time. Feel free to check it out if you are keen to know more about it.

<h3>1. Avenue <small class="highlight">(<a href="https://github.com/borisding/avenue">GitHub Repo</a>)</small></h3>
<p>
Home-bake PHP MVC framework for rapid web prototyping and development. The idea behind of this framework is inspired by <a href="https://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana</a> HMVC framework. Basically, I initiated this project due to sick of the frequent change and non backward compatible of framework APIs out there. Also, take this project as a challenge to myself and craft it as what I want it to be.

<h3>2. Avenue-Express <small class="highlight">(<a href="https://github.com/borisding/avenue-express">GitHub Repo</a>)</small></h3>
<p>
A starter that allows developers to implement typical server-side MVC design in Node <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework. The routing idea is basically borrowed from the Avenue project.
