Hi — My name is Boris Ding Poh Hing and I'm from Malaysia. I started working full-time in web development since 2006. I'm currently working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten">Rakuten</a> as front-end engineer, based in Singapore.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Prior to Rakuten, I was a full-stack web developer and mostly working on various web-based business applications, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and project management systems.
</p>

<p>
The web is moving fast and technologies have emerged. Especially, front-end technologies are taking more and more responsibilities in web applications nowadays. While moving forward in my career, I found it is always having fun and challenging when come to working on front-end and since then, I gradually put my focus on front-end technologies.
</p>

<p>
Now, I work full-time in front-end development and thus, writing JavaScript has since become my routine task in my day job.
</a>

<p>
Well, although there is a change in my career path, I have not stopped writing back-end code. When not at work, I like to fiddle around with my side-projects which are mostly written in JavaScript and PHP programming languages. Meanwhile, I'm also dabbling in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework. 
</p>

<p>
Besides coding, I'm also interested in software architecture and web development best practices, as well as entrepreneurship.
When not doing with web stuff, I mostly spend my time on reading and photography.
