Hi â€” My name is <label>Boris Ding Poh Hing</label> and I'm from Malaysia. I started working full-time in web development since 2006. I'm currently working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten">Rakuten</a> as front-end engineer, based in Singapore.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Prior to Rakuten, I was a full-stack web developer and mostly working on various web-based business applications, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and project management systems.
</p>

<p>
The web is moving fast and technologies have emerged. Especially, front-end technologies are taking more and more responsibilities in web applications nowadays. While moving forward in my career, I found it is always having fun and challenging when come to working on front-end and since then, I gradually put my focus on front-end technologies.
</p>

<p>
Now, I work full-time in front-end development and thus, writing JavaScript has since become my routine task in my day job.
</a>

<p>
Well, although there is a change in my career path, I have not stopped writing back-end code. When not at work, I like to fiddle around with my side-projects which are mostly written in <label>JavaScript</label> and <label>PHP</label> programming languages. Meanwhile, I'm also dabbling in <label><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a></label> with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework.
</p>

<p>
Besides coding, I'm also interested in software architecture and web development best practices, as well as entrepreneurship.
When not doing with web stuff, I mostly spend my time on reading and photography.
</p>

<p>
I was officially graduated from University of Technology, Malaysia with my Bachelor of Computer Science degree in year 2006.
</p>

<h3>Why this homepage and what</h3>

Technically, this website is designed in single page user experience with the help of <a href="https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/">client-side router</a> and some written <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borisding/borisding.github.io/master/public/src/js/app.js">vanilla JS</a>. It also uses CSS pre-processor (LESS) for styling.
