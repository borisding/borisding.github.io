Hi â€” My name is <span class="highlight">Boris Ding Poh Hing</span> and I'm from Malaysia. I started working full-time in web development since 2006. I'm currently working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten">Rakuten</a> as front-end engineer, located in Singapore.
</p>

<h3>More about me</h3>

<p>
Prior to Rakuten, I was a full-stack web developer and mostly working on various web-based business applications, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and project management systems. Now, I work front-end web development on advertising platform for Marketing Platform Department.
</a>

<p>
I'm passionate about web development and basically comfortable with both client and back-end. When not at work, I like to fiddle around with my side-projects which are mostly written in <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> and <span class="highlight">PHP</span> programming languages. Meanwhile, I'm also dabbling in <span class="highlight"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a></span> with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework.
</p>

<p>
Besides coding, I'm also interested in software architecture and web development best practices, as well as entrepreneurship.
When not doing with web stuff, I mostly spend my time on reading and photography.
</p>

<p>
I was officially graduated from University of Technology, Malaysia with my Bachelor of Computer Science degree in year 2006.
